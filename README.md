## Overview

Digital Atelier solves a real-world gap — thousands of shop owners have great products but zero online presence. Hiring a developer is expensive, learning to code takes months, and existing platforms are either too complex or too limiting.

Digital Atelier gives shop owners a simple, guided flow to build and publish a professional website in minutes — no technical knowledge needed.

---

## Problem Statement

> **"Why can't shop owners create websites without coding knowledge?"**

**Shop Owners:**
- Cannot afford to hire developers for a basic storefront
- Existing builders (WordPress, Wix) are confusing for non-technical users
- No platform is tailored specifically for small physical shop owners

**Customers:**
- Cannot discover local shops online
- Miss out on products from nearby boutiques and stores that have no digital presence

| Pro Subscription | Unlimited products, custom domain, premium themes |
| Transaction Fee | Small percentage on orders (Phase 2) |
| White Label | Custom-branded builder for agencies and enterprises |

---

## KPIs

- Number of storefronts published — target: grow month-on-month
- Time to publish first storefront — target: under 10 minutes
